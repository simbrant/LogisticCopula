Description: This package implements a method of extending a logistic regression
    model beyond linear effects of the covariates. The extension in is
    constructed by first equating the logistic regression model to a naive Bayes
    model, that is, a model for Y given X that is specified through the
    distribution of X given Y, where the columns of X are assumed to be mutually
    independent conditional on Y. Subsequently, the model is expanded by 
    adding vine - copulas to relax the assuption of mutual independence,
    where pair-copulas are added in a stage-wise, forward selection manner.
    Some heuristics are employed during the process of selecting edges,
    as well as the families of pair-copula models. After each component is
    added, the parameters are updated by a (smaller) number of gradient steps
    to maximise the likelihood. When the algorithm has stopped adding edges,
    based the criterion that a new edge should improve the likelihood more than
    k times the number new parameters, the parameters are updated with a larger
    number of gradient steps, or until convergence.
